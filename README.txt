Ferro
===========

Ferro aims to be a python package to ease manipulation of ferroelectric (and perhaps ferromagnetic) test data. It includes a HysteresisData class for read-in, storage, and display of PV/PUND/IV measurements as well as the beginning of a Landau modeling class (work in progress).

Docstrings are in numpy style. For an example of a complete device analysis, see Ferro/bin/multidomainAnalysis.py

Developed on python 3.5 and 3.6. Here are the installed versions of packages on my development computer:
