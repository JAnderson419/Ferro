Ferro
===========

Ferro aims to be a python package to ease manipulation of ferroelectric (and perhaps someday ferromagnetic) test data. It includes a HysteresisData class for read-in, storage, and display of PV/PUND/IV measurements as well as the beginning of a Landau modeling class (work in progress).
