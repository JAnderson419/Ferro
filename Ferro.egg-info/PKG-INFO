Description: ===========
        Ferro
        ===========
        
        Ferro aims to be a python package to ease manipulation of ferroelectric (and perhaps ferromagnetic) test data. It includes a HysteresisData class for read-in, storage, and display of PV/PUND/IV measurements as well as the beginning of a Landau modeling class (work in progress).
        
        Docstrings are in numpy style. For an example of a complete device analysis, see Ferro/bin/multidomainAnalysis.py
        
        Developed on python 3.5 and 3.6.
